    <p>Pine&amp;Birch was founded by Emma Schram and Shae Scotten in Vancouver, B.C. After meeting at design school, Emma and Shae found a shared passion for woodworking. Through this passion they begun creating wooden toys for their family and friends. Word spread and they begun to spend all their time in their garages creating toys for customers. A few months later, the Pine&amp;Birch online shop was born</p>
